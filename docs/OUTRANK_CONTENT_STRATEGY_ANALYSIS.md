## 6. Implementation Strategy for Your Tool

### Phase 1: Content Generation Improvements

**Update AI Prompt to Include:**

```

3. **Data Integration**
```
Include at least 3 specific examples with:

```

4. **Visual Content Placeholders**
```
After each major section, add:

```

### Phase 2: Technical Implementation

**A. Add Subsection Generation**

Location: `app/api/ai/content-writer/route.ts` or content generation prompt

```

**Enhanced Structure:**
```
Generate an article with:

For the main body, create 4-6 H2 sections, each with:

- Create anchor links for long-form content
- Suggest related articles based on H2 topics
```

**C. Add Structured Data Generation**

Create: `lib/generate-schema.ts`

```typescript
export function generateArticleSchema(article: {
  title: string;
  sections: Array<{ heading: string; content: string }>;
  faqs: Array<{ question: string; answer: string }>;
}) {
  return {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Article",
    "headline": article.title,
    // ... article schema
    "hasPart": article.sections.map(section => ({
      "@type": "WebPageElement",
      "name": section.heading,
    })),
  };
}

export function generateFAQSchema(faqs: Array<{question: string, answer: string}>) {
  return {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "FAQPage",
    "mainEntity": faqs.map(faq => ({
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": faq.question,
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
